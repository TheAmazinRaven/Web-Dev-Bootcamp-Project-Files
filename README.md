# Wev-Dev-Bootcamp-Project-Files

**5.24.20**

Today is 5.24.20, I've been working on the Web Developer Bootcamp every day since 5.4.20 with the exception of a break (from the 19th-22nd). I finally got the bright idea (:woman_facepalming:) that I should actually upload my code to GitHub along w notes & things I've learned. This will sort of serve as a log. :)

I am currently on the **Advanced CSS** part of the course learning how to do the box model. (While simultaneously  learning Git o-o;)
